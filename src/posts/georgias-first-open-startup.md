A﻿n open startup is a business that makes everything transparent. From the profit-and-loss statements to conversations with employees, open startups share everything except passwords.

A﻿nd today I'm making my business [LaunchEffect ](https://launcheffect.io)an open startup. We're going to share everything: What we're making, how we're hiring, and the journey to a successful business.

I﻿f I'm not mistaken, we are Georgia's first open startup. The USA has some, and Europe has a few... But as far as I could find, Georgia has none.

U﻿ntil now.

H﻿ere's what to expect:

E﻿very month, we're going to publish our profit and loss statements for the last month. You can see what our income was and where our expenses came from.

I﻿ also plan to publish moments along the entrepreneurial journey; critical decisions I made, how I hire all stars, and the ups and downs of an entrepreneur's life.

C﻿ompanies and governments today are opaque like mud. I want to be transparent, open to feedback, and helpful to other entrepreneurs.

U﻿se my business as a training grounds, a learning place. I will make the mistakes and successes so you can learn from me.

T﻿ogether we can make the world a more transparent place.
