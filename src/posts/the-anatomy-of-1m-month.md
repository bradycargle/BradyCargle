W﻿hat would my business look like if it was making $1,000,000 per month, post tax, pure profit?

W﻿hat customers would I have? Which of my customers are not a fit for this mission?

H﻿ow would we be serving our customers?

W﻿ould I still have the same team? Who isn't a fit for this mission?

W﻿hat products and add-ons would we sell?

I﻿n this post we're going to look at these questions, break them down, and build an outline for a business that makes this kind of achievement.

## Mission of a $1M/month company

The mission of a business that makes $1M/month (with a valuation probably close to $100M) has to be broad, yet specific. Specific, yet powerful. 

It has to state who our customers are, what we help them do, and how.

It has to explain how we ascend customers in our value ladder, who we help them become, what other offers we have available.

Our mission statement is this:

We help local businesses to grow by applying technology to the business

This might be a great value ladder mission statement (the kind that tells you how to ascend customers up your value ladder) but it’s lame for hiring. Who wants to join a company that makes the rich even richer?

I need something huge, audacious, even stupid. Something that people read and think “Wow, now that would change the world.”

Some ideas:

* We want every one of our clients to be a millionaire
* We want our clients to process one billion dollars
* We want our clients to get one billion pageviews
* We want every one of our clients to make a million dollars as a result of working with us

I like the first and last ones of these. I don’t love that the first one doesn’t count clients who are already millionaires. And the last one is a little long…

But let’s go with the last one.

This gives us a nice north star: Is this going to make our client a million bucks? If no, don’t do it. In the future, I want to change this to $10,000,000. Then maybe 100…

This is a good goal. It’s a sexy goal; we’re making millionaires. And if my employees are entrepreneurial, we’re going to make them millionaires too.

What if we did an employee mission statement as well?

Something like:

We help our employees to achieve financial freedom by doing the best work of their life, participating in the financial success of the company, and being paid above market rates for their work

At their core, I think these missions will work because they’re selfless. The company succeeds only when

* Our customers succeed
* Our employees succeed

We only get rich when they get rich

This is a mission worthy of a $100M company.

With our mission down, let’s talk about our customers.

## Math, Customers, & Products

A﻿ business that makes one big M per month would need a lot of customers paying a lot of money, or a whole lot of customers who only paid a little.

But I don’t want to just make a single big M. I want to make a single big M net profit post tax. If tax is 30% and my profit margin is 50% (good ballpark estimates), I really need $2.6M per month.

A business making $1M per month is gonna have a fat multiple on it; several years worth. As said before, we might be looking at a business worth $100M when all is said and done.

Staggering numbers. Staggering amounts of work and organization necessary.

(and somehow still easier than working a job for 40 years for literal fractions of a percent of this value)

To get to this level, we need a machine. A big, fat, blubbery kind of machine with trains that always run on time. It has to be efficient, but what about size?

We either need a very efficient big machine, or a very efficient very big machine.

Right now most of our customers are paying about $200/month. What they get for that price doesn’t matter, but to make $1M per month earnings after tax ($2.6M/month total), we would need over 13,000 of these customers. 

My sales close rate is pretty good, but repetitions have still been low, so let’s say we’re at a 50% close rate. I would need 26,000 sales calls. Some leads won’t show up to sales calls, so let’s say we need 52,000 leads. But screw that, screw 52,000 leads, where do I even get 5,000 leads? What’s my funnel for them? Are there that many businesses in the world who would give me the time of day?

To achieve those numbers, I need an incredible method of lead generation.

To hit my goal this way is to have a very efficient, very big machine.

But there might be a way to hit my goal by having a machine that’s only big instead of very big.

Let’s say I was making a website plus custom software for a business; maybe they’re getting payment processing, or creating logins for their sales reps and distributors, or allowing customers to upload information.

I could price this at $1,000 per month and I think there are a lot of businesses who wouldn’t bat an eye. I have an enterprise client like this right now; we’re doing a lot of work, they’re paying us a lot of money, and they will be saving goliath--sized amounts of time and energy once our software is in place.

At this price point, I need 2,600 of these clients to hit my goal.

My close rate for this kind of client is 100% so far (with one lead :), but let’s say we’re back to 50% as in the example above. That’s 5,200 phone calls, 10,400 leads.

That’s a lot, a whole lot. But a lot better than 52,000.

### Churn

With both of these approaches, I will run into problems of scale. Whether I need 13,000 clients or 2,600, churn is going to cap my growth rate far below either of the numbers that I need. Say churn is low, just 5%. If I have 1,000 customers, I will need to add on 50 new customers per month. Right now we can add on 5 new customers per month, so I’m capped at 100 clients with a 5% churn. 100 clients will earn me $20,000 - $100,000 per month. This number is somewhere between 0.8% and 3.8% of total revenue I need.

Awesome.

There are a few ways around this problem of churn, the best of which is just decreasing it. If I could get churn to 4% instead of 5% (lifetime of the customer being 25 months instead of 20), I would cap out with 125 clients. This 1% decrease in churn would result in an additional $5,000 - $25,000 in revenue per month.

If I could get churn all the way down to 2% (meaning the average lifetime of a customer is 50 months), then I will max out at 250 clients, $50,000 - $250,000 revenue per month.

We’re looking better, but still only at 2-10% of the final goal.

Low churn needs to be at the top of my list from day 1, and at some point I will still run into problems of acquisition.

As long as I can get only 5 new customers per month, I will forever be very limited.

Right now my cap is logistical; I’m very involved with every customer. I think this is a good thing for now, but I’m working on removing myself as a roadblock. It takes time to train up the people who can do this (and it requires money I don’t have yet). 

On the easy-to-sell, easy-to-fulfill spectrum, I’m still at easy-to-sell. I’ll add friction later once I am consistently paying all my expenses.

But if we can get just 10 clients per month, then we’re doubling our cap again. Now we’re at $100,000 - $500,000 per month income. 4-20% of where we need to be.

From here the math gets tougher. We either need to cut churn by 80% (taking our average customer’s life to 250 months) or take on 50+ clients per month.

Ouch. I’d have better luck getting to 2nd base with a nun.

### Scaling

At it’s core, this is a problem of scaling. How can any business grow, and grow faster than it’s dying?

There are two ways to get out of this scaling problem:

1. Massive increase in how many customers we can take on
2. * Could be software upsell with $0 cost of replication
   * Could be through acquisition of other companies
   * Could get us part of the way there with amazing SOPs and a strong team of humans, but hiring a bunch of people isn’t preferable
3. Massive increase in revenue per customer
4. * Upsells
   * * Software upsell
     * Service upsell (in my industry, could be SEO, store, customer logins)
   * Increase lifetime of a customer
   * * Offer Satan my firstborn to never allow customers to leave, thus solving all my problems
     * ??? Not sure how else to do this other than just offering a dang good service

So it seems like I can boil down all my options to a simple few:

1. Sell SaaS for low cost of replication + upsells. This seems like it would solve a lot of problems
2. Sell additional services (custom software, SEO) as higher-priced items or as upsells. This can solve many problems, but comes at the cost of hiring more people
3. Acquire other businesses, sell their customers SaaS or additional services. Hard, but can work

And it’s reasonable to pursue all of these… but what if I could only choose one? Let’s assume I can do one - a single one.

Each has a pro and a con. SaaS has low cost of replication and can be very sticky, but it’s harder to make.

Additional services could be huge money makers, but require additional manpower and organization.

Acquisition is a whole different skillset, and takes a lot of capital.

So with my available options, cash, talent, and desires, I’d like to sell SaaS or additional services. Each of these solves scaling problems in different ways; SaaS through easy acquisition, services through very high price points.

I would rather do SaaS. It’s more in line with my interests, more in line with where I want to go. It’s sexy, saying I own a software company. Acquisition seems more fun to me. Less client headache.

But for now… why not both?

Why not sell SaaS if possible, sell additional services as an upsell? I can use this selling process to forever improve my SaaS, making sure to sell it as it’s improved, to keep it in line with what customers want.

When I have a feedback call with clients, I can offer an SEO report or review gathering tool, both of which will help them get more clients.

It’s impossible to predict exactly how this will affect churn, revenue, and the growth cap of my business… but the only thing that can happen is that clients, all clients, tell me no… or they say yes, and it gets me closer to the goal.

I still won’t be all the way there though; I suspect long term, I will need to build a very good SaaS product or a very good agency.  Maybe at ~$1,000,000 per year, I’ll make the switch from agency to SaaS.

With a SaaS product selling for $99/month, I will need 10,101 customers to make $1,000,000. Believe it or not, 10,101 or even 20,202 seems far more reasonable to me than the built-in manpower-blockade that will cause every agency to struggle.

I think my end goal will be something like this:

* Have an agency that has 1,000 clients at $1,000/month
* Have a SaaS that has 10,000 clients at $100/month

The 2nd seems far easier than the 1st in terms of customer acquisition. It just seems almost impossible to me to have an agency with the necessary numbers of clients. The only real option is to offer very high-priced services, several thousand-dollar-per-month SEO packages or custom software.

At the end of the day, I just don’t see a practical way for agencies to grow to this level. I do see a practical way for SaaS to grow to this level.

And when I think about it like that, it’s obvious where my long-term goals should lie.

(Side note: it might be interesting to offer software with a service (SwaS). Something like: It’s $99/month to setup yourself, additional $500 for us to set up for you. Or perhaps we could just include this in one of our higher-priced plans - $499/month gets you a concierge)

### Customers

I will need a specific type of customer to get where I need to go: the kind of customer who invests in themselves, who knows that businesses and growth take time. 

Not just any Bob, Larry, or Joe, but someone ideal.

I’ve already written out an ideal avatar, so here it is: 

* Hard working guy who wants to put bread on the table and feed his family
* Has a successful business and is good at what he does
* Probably played sports
* Has kids, maybe grandkids
* Values home style cooking
* Values family
* Hard working, honest person who doesn't like technology
* Doesn't want to learn technology
* Doesn't want to be sold to
* Values their reputation above everything else
* Skilled worker, often good with their hands
* Would describe himself as honest, fair
* Involved in some local organization like a church or nonprofit
* Practical, doesn't believe in miracles
* Understands the need for technology
* Worked corporate before going their own path
* Knows that delayed gratification today (investment) leads to a better tomorrow

I added the last bullet point: “Knows that delayed gratification today (investment) leads to a better tomorrow”. This wasn’t in my ideal customer description, but I think it’s relevant. My ideal customer thinks in terms of ROI: he’s wondering where he can put some money now to make more money later. He doesn’t believe in miracles, but he does believe in growth.

Alex Hormozi preaches that until I’m at $1M/year, I should stick to one avatar, one channel of acquisition, one product. This is a good avatar… but what about acquisition?

### Customer Acquisition

When it comes to acquisition, the short answer is that I don’t know.

There, ya happy?

There are a few ways I can acquire customers: affiliate programs, content (like this, blessed be yer eyes that are upon it), paid ads, referrals, SEO.

I’m not a big fan of paid ads, so my strategy up to this point:

1. SEO. Get way more reviews than everyone else, master local SEO (already got my biggest client this way, but this is a long term strategy - 12+ months to start being effective)
2. Offer $100 referral bonus every time someone sends a friend to sign up (can start working now)
3. Start producing content like this. I imagine this strategy is slow, so I’m planning on 12+ months before seeing any results)

But to be honest, I have no idea how to get new customers. I’m clueless. I feel like I’m floundering in the dark.

Maybe I’ll hire a mentor or something.

One of these methods that I’m optimistic about is YouTube. I think having some presence on YouTube could be very powerful; it establishes me as the authority, it’s a lot faster than SEO, and less competitive than websites. I think it has the potential to be very helpful.

I say that I don’t know anything regarding customer acquisition; but I must know something. I’ve gotten ~1 new client per week I’ve worked since this business started. Honestly, it’s all felt like God being good to me. 

We’ll see how much I know a year from now. I’d like to be at $5,000 MRR at the end of the year.

But growing this company won’t just depend on churn, scaling, customers, and acquisition. It will also depend on the team.

## The Dream Team and Where to Find Them

I’m finding all of my current team through Upwork. Generalized across all my hires, I look for people who:

* Are passionate
* Are kind and friendly
* Make me smile
* Are good at their job (though this is less important than talent)

My philosophy is that talent can be taught to the person who has the right mindset. And right now this hiring process works; my team only has to be better than my competition: my competition that only hires locals or has no team at all. I can hire great people at a fraction of the cost of my competitors. There is a small drop in quality of their English levels, but this is an easy fix. Technical skills are at least what I can find in the USA.

But the team I have is not the team who will make my dreams come true. I will need more. More developers, more customer support, more everything. This doesn’t mean that I will fire my current team, but that I will need new people too. My team right now works right now, my team acquisition works right now, but what about when my competition is better? What about when I’m no longer a small town web dev, but someone who is competing on an international level? What about when my best players are getting poached, or when to find the best players, I have to do the poaching?

“All of the most productive people already have a job.” - Alex Hormozi

It’s sobering: What I have now won’t get me to where I want to go. I will need something different, different people, probably people who are employed already.

This would mean a whole machine just of recruiting people who are already employed, doing what everyone else is doing, expecting a 2 year churn for every employee (at best)

So what if I did things a different way?

A mission, something that would get employees out of bed in the morning, something that makes us near poaching-proof.

The two businesses that come to mind are 37signals and ConvertKit. Both have massive employee retentions (10+ years). What are they doing?

* Basecamp writes on job applications: “We work hard to make sure every employee is given the freedom, tools, trust, and support to do the best work of their careers” We value a calm company and deliberate, concerted effort. You’ll have fewer meetings, hardly any email, and far fewer interruptions than you’re used to. 8-hour days and 40-hour weeks are plenty of time to do great work, so that’s all we expect. 
* Strong mission: Basecamp helps growing businesses organize their projects, internal communications, and client work in one place so they have a central source of truth. ConvertKit helps creators earn a living
* Both have a HUGE emphasis on teaching. Teaching clients, teaching potential customers, teaching employees
* Both emphasize generosity
* Both put the emphasis on their customers - we succeed when they succeed
* Both make their businesses very “open”
* ConvertKit says “Our unfair advantage is that we care more.”
* High, standardized salaries
* Strong benefits (including home-office setup and stipends, or coworking space payments)
* Profit sharing (Basecamp: 10%, CK: 52%)
* Emphasis on growth and improvement

What if I did all of this and published content, made my mission public, so that instead of me forever having to poach and churn employees, potential hires came to me because of who we are? Because of our mission, our culture, what we do and how we act?

My mission can’t just be that we’re going to help the rich get richer. It has to be that we’re going to make every one of our clients earn over a million dollars with us. It has to be that we’re going to make every employee of ours financially free, beyond financially free.

We’re going to make everyone associated with us rich.

And that’s the only way we’ll succeed.
