Yesterday, LaunchEffect became [Georgia's first open startup](https://bradycargle.com/posts/georgias-first-open-startup/). I will share everything about the business: from finances to decisions to conversations, you can get everything except my passwords from me.

"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed."

*\-Stephen King, The Dark Tower*

This is my favorite opening line to a book. The man in black (probably a bad, bad man) is running from… a gunslinger? Like, Clint Eastwood?

One line and you see the bad guy running from the good guy. There’s a sense of danger, action in the air. Something is about to go down, and I want to know what it is.

Running a business is like this. The good guy is you (don’t we always believe that we are the good guys?) ready to shoot the bad guys of corporate bosses and overdrafted bank accounts. We business owners are chasing our dream, making things happen where things weren’t happening, trying to earn a buck, hoping to not go under.

It’s a race against the clock (our expenses) and the competition. A race for our life and liberty and happiness and a fat checking account to boot, dang it. We don’t want to have our cake and eat it too, but make our cake and sell it so we can buy more flour and sugar and eggs and still take some home to the bank.

Being an “open business” means making this journey public, allowing others a peek inside to see the dirty laundry. Not just profit and loss statements–though these are public too–but every decision is put on display. Our secrets are open for business, and they’re free, so grab one, grab two, take as many as you like. Everything but the passwords are yours to take.

Being an open business comes with risk: by spending time writing about the past I lose time to focus on the future, the customers, making the product better. If business is good–not even great but good, just fine will do ya–then it will be copycatted. Say what you want about product differentiation and standing out from the crowd, but if I could be surrounded by competition or give every website maker crab claws for hands (so they can’t type, you know), I’d go with the 2nd option.

So why make my business open at all? Why share what everyone else keeps private?

A few reasons.

I want to give away everything except the passwords because I wish someone had done this for me. Entrepreneurship is hard. Most businesses fail fast, and a few fail slow, but the rest of them make it. And when you think about it this way, you can see that most businesses don’t need an exit strategy, but an exist strategy. If you can just make it 10 years, you’re golden. You’re in the 1% of businesses.

Being able to see my mistakes might save someone else from making them. I’m being the mentor who I wish that I had. This is a fundamentally good thing because entrepreneurs innovate and innovation is the way forward; finding new ways to serve others, to create new products, to give the world what it didn’t know it wanted. This kind of innovation unearths the secrets of the universe and places them in our hands to wield.

Entrepreneurs take these secrets, package them in an offer, and trade these offers for more resources until everyone can have the offer for almost free. One day’s worth of food used to cost at least one day’s worth of labor. You work one day so you can eat that night. If your work doesn’t go so well, you don’t eat. A hunter who had a bad day at the office would go without dinner. Now, you can buy a day’s worth of food in a grocery store for a couple hours of minimum-wage salary and even the worst office days don’t threaten us with starvation.

To me, this means that entrepreneurship is the way forward. It is uncovering new knowledge of the universe in an efficient and sustainable way.

These open reports will be so open because I want other entrepreneurs to be able to learn from my mistakes. To see what works and what doesn’t. To learn the intricacies of building authority, structuring an offer, maintaining customers, hiring, automating, and profiting.

I will make mistakes. I will fail.

But maybe someone else doesn’t have to.

And last, I write these reports because I want you to trust me. I want you to like me, to see me as an upstanding guy.  It helps my business for you to believe I’m worth trusting with your brand.

Maybe this blog post is what gets a customer off the fence about buying. Maybe it causes you to tell a friend about me.

Either way, I enjoy writing these and whether they’re read or not, it makes me feel good. That is enough for one lifetime.
